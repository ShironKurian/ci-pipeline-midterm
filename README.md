# Flask Calculator App with CI/CD Pipeline

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is a simple Flask web application that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker to automate testing and deployment.

## 🛠️ Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations via REST API
- Unit testing with pytest
- Containerized with Docker
- Automated CI/CD pipeline

## API Endpoints

- **Addition:** `GET /add?a=5&b=3` → `{ "result": 8 }`
- **Subtraction:** `GET /subtract?a=10&b=4` → `{ "result": 6 }`
- **Multiplication:** `GET /multiply?a=3&b=3` → `{ "result": 9 }`
- **Division:** `GET /divide?a=10&b=2` → `{ "result": 5 }`

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ci-pipeline-midterm.git
cd ci-pipeline-midterm
```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Run the Flask app:**
```bash
python app/app.py
```

5. **Test the endpoints:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/add?a=5&b=3"
```

## 🐳 Docker Setup

Docker Image
The Docker image for this project is built automatically by our CI pipeline and pushed to Docker Hub. Follow the steps below to pull and run the Docker container:

Pulling the Image
To pull the latest version of the Docker image from Docker Hub, run:

docker pull shironkurian/ci-pipeline-midterm:latest
Running the Container
After pulling the image, you can run it locally by mapping the container's port 5000 to your local machine. For example:

docker run -p 5000:5000 shironkurian/ci-pipeline-midterm:latest
Once the container is running, access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to:

http://localhost:5000/add?a=5&b=3
You should see a JSON response similar to:

{"result": 8}
Additional Information
Image Name: shironkurian/ci-pipeline-midterm
Tag: latest
Base Image: python:3.12-slim
CI/CD: The image is built and pushed automatically via our GitHub Actions workflow after all tests pass.

1. **Build the Docker image:**
```bash
docker build -t flask-app .
```

2. **Run the container:**
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app
```

3. **Access the API:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:5000/add?a=5&b=3"
```

## ✅ Testing with Pytest

1. **Run tests locally:**
```bash
pytest tests/
```

2. **Run tests inside Docker:**
```bash
docker exec <container_id> pytest tests/
```

## 🛠️ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

The project uses GitHub Actions to automate:
- **Build:** Create Docker images
- **Test:** Run the test suite
- **Deploy:** Push Docker images to Docker Hub (on passing tests)

### Configure GitHub Secrets

- `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password or access token

## 📄 Workflow File (ci.yml)

Located in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, this file automates the build, test, and deploy steps whenever code is pushed.
